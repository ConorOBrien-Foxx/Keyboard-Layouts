The title of this would be in small caps if github let me. Q_Q

This is a keyboard layout bundle collection I created, it runs only on OS X I think.  

If you figure out a way to get it working on Windows, start an issue descibing how.

On OS X, put the 3 bundles (normally looks like a lego AFAIK) in `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.

On Windows, I have no clue how, please tell me if you know. :D
