# Small-Caps-keyboard-layout

The title of this would be in small caps if github let me. Q_Q

This is a keyboard layout bundle I created, it runs only on OS X I think.  

If you figure out a way to get it working on Windows, post to the issue about it please.

On OS X, put the whole Smallcaps.bundle (normally looks like a lego AFAIK) in `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`.
